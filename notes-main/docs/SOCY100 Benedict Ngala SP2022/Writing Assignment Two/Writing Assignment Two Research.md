-->  Neo-Marxian Model
- Wright uses class to explain and predict people's material interests and lived experiences, living conditions, incomes, etc. etc. 
	- However, the class analysis of Marx's day did not exactly account for all the complexities. Thus, Wright began to account for [advanced capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_capitalism "Advanced capitalism") and "[post-capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-capitalist "Post-capitalist")" societies.
	- Important factors are 
		1.   control over and exclusion from access to economic/productive resources;
		2.   location within production relations;
		3.   market capacity in exchange relations;
		4.    differential control over income derived from the use of productive resources; and
		5.    differential control over labor effort in defining "class", while at the same time trying to account for the situation of expert, skilled, manager, and supervisory employees, taking inspiration from [Weberian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber "Max Weber") accounts of class and class analysis.

**"The Class Nature of the State Bureaucracy"**
- #KarlMarx's critique of Hegel explained bureaucracy as a "conflict of interests and classes in capitalist society."
- State bureaucracy lacked any "universal interest"
	- In essence, the structure of a bureaucracy leads directly to the class conflicts you see in society. You've got your janitor, then you've got the president of the whole organization. It's just a super-concentrated version of the contradictions in society. 
- The "Relative autonomy" of the state and the "relative hegemony" of the state elite 
	- The bureaucracy itself is functionally autonomous, however, every choice made in the business is made according to the top-down model. The business can do whatever, but the people in it? They answer to the president, or the leader or something. They don't have power. It isn't democracy. 
- "The problems, conflicts, and vicious cycles of bureaucracy then become part of this same structure. For example, if the administrator can offer individual rewards he can also control by divide and rule."
	- Think *Sorry to Bother You* where they divide up the working mass via a "promise" that someone will eventually get to be a "super-seller" and how that promise of more money than Cash's peers essentially led him down the pathway to becoming what some would call a "class traitor"
	- However, in the document we are analyzing for this paper, it marks a very strong difference: 
		- Some bureaucracies are divided up on *racial* lines as well. Therefore, certain relationships are more impenetrable and even more like "us v. them" than it would have been in *Sorry to Bother You* 
		- Employees may develop common interests: 
			- This is a #ConflictTheory idea here, of #ClassConsciousness which is present in the text we were given to write about: 
				- It is in the context of the break room that Roberto and another colleague eventually tell Steve that he is almost Mexican and they also refer to all workers, regardless of national origin, as being Mexican.

The Outline 
--> Introductory paragraph 
- Steve Striffler, in getting his hands into the shit, blood, and putrid scents of working in a Tyson Chicken Factory, showed us not only the separation between us and our food, but also, our separation from the world where it's made. However, it isn't true that things are *so* different. All of us exist in more or less similar versions of the super-structure of bureaucracy that we see in this paper-- and as a result, we all sit in the same shackles of class.
--> Paragraph 2
- In US culture, there has been a long bent toward authority and respect thereof-- this was, of course, an inexcapable factor of the US being birthed out of Britain; the divine right of kings and most other social theories highlighted the undeniable importance of respecting authority and were the most predominant social theories at the time. Our culture also consists of contradictory strains of values; we hold dear the idea that one should move their way up. We also hold dear ideas about being able to own what you have. These cultural factors help us understand our first point about bureaucracy and its roots in class conflict. Take this quote from Striffler; "Michael [the supervisor]canâ€™t do the job himself and [tells me to do what Roberto does]."
	- This may, on first glance, seem out of place; however, in systems of bureaucracy, we see cultural values reflected, and in those cultural values, we see the storied results of class conflict. Class is the division of society based on the wealth or status of its groups-- here, we see class concreted. Those with the *means* to be college educated, like, say, Michael, a "college educated supervisor," become  members of a higher class than say, Roberto, the breading operator. As a result, he is placed in a higher position in the *bureaucracy* of the plant than others. This allows for the understanding of bureaucracy to emerge; a bureaucracy, more than a formal group based on impersonal relations, is a concentration of the class contradictions of the society from which it emerges. Furthermore, with this established understanding of bureaucracy, we can take our eyes further out.
