#SocialStratification:
-	A hierarchical arrangement of peoples according to their relative property, power and prestige. 
	-	Property divides people into 
		-	The rich 
		-	The poor 
		-	And these groups do not relate as equals. 
#ProfNgala’s insight: He asked “could I get a private jet as a professor?” We answered, “No.” He explained how his position in society excludes him from the luxuries that the very rich have, and that these luxuries lead people to behave very differently. “We operate in different worlds due to the choices available to us” 


#Slavery 
- The ownership of some individuals by other individuals 
	- We know it better in the Americas as the system of chattel slavery— but this was generally uncharacteristic of slavery until the TransAtlantic Slave trade, which essentially codified racial lines as the markers of who was and was not a slave in law in US history. 
- #Slavery tended to be temporary in some places
	- The Israelite jubilee year, where all slaves were freed 
	- Roman slaves, who could buy their freedom
- #Slavery was not necessarily inherited
- Children of slaves may be adopted by the owning family 
- Slaves were not necessarily powerless and poor 
- In some groups, slaves could acquire property
- In the New World (the Americas) there was a system of indentured servitude 
- Also in the new world; 
	- The book notes here that #slavery was a system codified by law in the US. This made slavery a race-based institution. The book, however, does not outline the ways in which this race based institution continued after the outlaw of what we commonly know as #slavery. After the civil war, such things continued in the form of debt peonage, black codes, and convict leasing. 
- #Slavery continues today
- Continues with the sexual #slavery trade 
	- Continued in Niger until 2003 


#Caste 
- A system of social stratification which is a closed system and once you are born within it, you will always belong to that class
- People in these societies only marry within their group 
- Rules exist about ritual pollution to prevent interrelation between castes 
#ClosedSystem v. #OpenSystem 
- #OpenSystems have 
	- Flexibility 
	- Social mobility 
		- Can go up or down in rank or status 
		- Made up of achieved statuses 
- #ClosedSystems (like caste systems or Slavery in the US) have 
	- No ability to move between classes or change status 
	- Ascribed at birth 


- Forms of stratification 
- Global stratification is an open system 
- Countries divided on wealth 
- #ClassStratification 
	- Allows for social mobility 
	- Laws do not specify someone’s occupation upon birth 
- What determines social class? 
	- #KarlMarx concluded that social class is dependent on how one relates to the means of production 
	- #Bourgeois
		- Own the means of production 
		- #Proletariat
			- Who work for the owners 
		- #Lumpenproletariat 
			- Beggars, vagrants, criminals
	- Max Weber debated this 
		- Claimed that these were the true factors  
			- Power 
				- the ability to control others against their objections
			- Property 
				- What they have control over
			- Prestige 
				- Respect and adoration, high status 
- Race is a closed system 
- Ethnic stratification is a closed system 
- Gender stratification is kind of a debate (trans people exist but this opens a new can of worms) 
- Estate Stratification 
	- Divided into castes based on land ownership 
		- First estate were nobles 
		- Second estate were priests and clergymen 
		- Third estate were commoners 
		- Women belonged to the estates of their husbands


- Why is Social Stratification Universal? 
#Davis and #Moore’s explanation went as: 
- For society to function, its positions must be filled 
- Some positions are more important than others 
- More important positions must be filled by more qualified people 
- To motivate more qualified people to fill these positions there must be greater reward
- Tumin’s critique of Davis and Moore 
- How do we know who is more important? 
	- Heart surgeons save lives, but garbage collectors may indeed save more by taking out the trash
	- Society would be a meritocracy under this model 
	- Merit is not key, but money 
	- Positions are based on more factors than merit
		- Social stratification is dysfunctional 
			- It doesn’t benefit the people it rightly should benefit
	- #Mosca’s argument in The Ruling Class 
		- No society can exist unorganized, thus needs leadership
		- Leadership requires inequality. Some people lead others don’t. 
		- Human nature is self-centered. People abuse their power. 
- #Lenski’s synthesis 
	- Functionalists are right when there’s no surplus 
	- Conflict theorists are right when there is a surplus. 

- How is stratification maintained? 
	- Soft Control
	- Ideologies are developed in order to maintain control
	- Divine right of kings
		- Authority is owed obedience
	- Controlling Information
	- Stifling Criticism
	- Big Brother Technology
#GlobalStratification 
- A system of first, second and third world nations 
- Populations of poor nations is higher 
- The rich have the means to reduce their population via contraceptives
- How did the World’s Nations become stratified? 
	- #Colonialism 
	- Europe moved to make “economic colonies” of nations with lots of raw materials
#WorldSystemTheory
- #Capitalism creates economic exploitation 
	- Core
		- Countries with the most capitalistic activity
	- Semi-periphery 
		- Countries on the margins
	- Periphery 
		- Countries being exploited
	- External area
		- Countries left out of #capitalism altogether
	- Globalized capitalism 
#Neocolonialism 
- Process of development is not free 
- Invention of the #IMF and the #WorldBank which give out loans to poor countries then expect them to pay those loans back which leaves the governments of those poor countries in terrible debt
- #WorldBank was founded in Brentwood, New Hampshire 
- To support Europe after WW2
- Continued after this and moved to “develop and civilize other nations” 
- #StructuralAdjustmentPrograms 
	- What governments needed to do to pay off loans, such as cutting off funding, etc. etc. 
	- Governments now have no money to pay for public services 
	- Interest is maintained despite this, perpetuating the situation 
	- Multinational corporations maximize profit in these nations because of “low cost of living” 
	- People in these countries still have high cost places that they simply cannot access, making their nations partially for the romps and tourism of rich countries
