***What is Social Class?***
--> Sociologists do not all agree on what makes social class how it is, however, most sociologists agree to use #MaxWeber's model of social class. This model is based on three factors: 
- **Property** 
	- Property is unequally distributed:
		- Here are some details:  
			- #Statistic: One percent of Americans own a third of all real estate, stocks, brokerages, etc. etc. 
			- #Statistic: Ten percent of Americans own 77 percent of the nation's wealth
			- #Figure

			- #Statistic: Let’s suppose that you started working the year Jesus was born and that you worked full time starting then. Let’s also assume that each year you earned today’s average per capita income of $42,693. As of this year, you would still have to work 600 more years to earn what the highest-paid executive listed in Table 10.1 earned in just one year
			- Notable, also, is the lifestyle difference and the abilities that the wealthy have to simply travel the world in a private jet with their own pilot, while others may need to decide between medicine or food. 

- **Power**
	- The US is dominated by a "power elite" which essentially hold all of the power in the US and control much of the political process 
	- This term was coined by #CWrightMill, who faced criticism for this stance in the 1950s because it did not accord with the idea that the people are in control of the government. 
		- He based this on an observation that the *ingroup* of power is deeply interrelated, and that they literally hire the same bands and groups for balls, have the same companies doing service for them, and that many US presidents come from white millionaire families known as "old money"
		- #WilliamDomhoff expanded on this: 
			- The power elite is so powerful that *no decision is made without its approval.*


- **Prestige**
	- Occupations and prestige
		- Some occupations are held with higher prestige than others
			- People make the distinction between white collar jobs and blue collar jobs, and white collar jobs are generally held to be more prestigious than blue collar. 
			- Here is a #Figure from the book to illustrate the distinction between how these jobs are viewed. 
				- ![[Pasted image 20220501174652.png]]
		- Prestigious jobs share these features: 
			- Pay more 
			- Require more education 
			- Involve more abstract thought 
			- Offer greater autonomy 


**Sociological Models of Social Class**
--> Updating #KarlMarx 
- #ErickOlinWright offers the explanation for why some people exist in #contradictoryclasslocations: 
	- What one person wants in accordance with their experience, say, supporting their laborers and ensuring they are taken care of, may not be possible in accordance with their *class position* or their job at the time which requires them to focus on profits. 
- Wright identified four classes: 
	1. Capitalists, who employ many workers 
	2. Petty bourgeoisie, small business owners
	3. Managers, who sell their own labor but exercise authority over other employees 
	4. Workers, who simply sell their labor to others 
		- The question the book poses is: *Where to put college professors?*
--> Updating #MaxWeber 
- #Figure 10.6
	- ![[Pasted image 20220501175716.png]]
- Divided up based on income. The groups are as follows: 
	- The #Capitalist Class: 
		- The 1 percent that is worth more than the entire bottom 90 percent of the country 
		- Owners of major media outlets, sports franchises, magazines, etc. etc. 
		- Pass on their social networks to their children, along with their assets 
		- Old money 
			- May not work for wages, may study business or become lawyers to manage the family fortune 
			- Have extensive political connections which they use to defend their empires
		- New money 
			- Have made fortunes in business, but are still outsiders to the upper class due to the fact that they have not attended the correct schools or been born into money 
			- Taste is suspect
	- Upper Middle Class 
		- Teachers and parents push children for upper middle class jobs 
		- Shaped by education 
	- Lower Middle Class 
		- Able to afford a mainstream lifestyle but struggle to maintain 
		- Face threats from the economy, inflation, recession and other insecurities. 
	- The Working Class
		- Relatively unskilled blue-collar and white-collar workers 
		- Compared to the middle class they have less education and lower incomes 
		- Jobs more routine, more supervised 
	- The Working Poor 
		- Low-paid workers who take on temporary or seasonal jobs 
		- May be illiterate 
		- Fear ending up on the streets
	- The Underclass 
		- The lowest rung: 
			- Little to no connection on the job market 
			- Do menial, low-paying, temporary work


**Consequences of Social Class**
--> Health 
- Life expectancy varies greatly from one place to the next
- People of old age in poor areas die sooner than those in rich areas
- Lifestyle is impacted by social class
	- Lower classes are more likely to smoke, eat a lot of fats, be overweight, abuse drugs, get little exercise 
- Life is also simply harder on poor people and stress leads people to suffer weakening immune systems and cause their bodies to wear out faster than their upper class counter parts 
- Also has mental health effects: 
	- The lower classes have worse mental health than the higher classes 
	- Mental illness comes with the higher stress of poverty 
	- More likely to divorce
	- More likely to be victim to crime 
	- More likely to have physical illness 
--> #Family Life 
- Capitalist class emphasizes family tradition 
	- Family history is emphasized
	- Every choice a child makes will have an impact on the family line 
- Divorce is more common in lower social classes 
	- Children of the poor are more likely to grow up in broken homes 
- Child rearing is more geared toward getting children to follow rules and obey authority in lower classes 
	- More geared around autonomy in middle-class areas
--> #Education 
- Upper classes will prepare their children for the educational world early 
- Preschools may even be entirely accounted for by the parents 
--> #Politics 
- Higher classes are more likely to vote for republicans 
- Working classes more likely to vote for democrats 
	- Working class, however, may be more conservative on social issues than democrats.
